# Creating Effective Agricultural Content for the Web

## Why Do Agricultural Companies Need the Web?

The World Wide Web has changed the way the world works in the twentieth century. From mobile devices to tablets, technology is changing the face of advertising and informing. Agriculture is an industry that not many people would think needs effective online designers, but in fact there is an ever increasing need for web designers that have some knowledge on how to code, but also what to incorporate into a website that is geared toward grain merchandising. This article will give some basic knowledge for beginner agricultural web designers on what to include in a grain merchandising website and how to lay out a website for the audience.

## What Content Should You Use?

Before you even begin to code your website, take some time and sit down with a pencil and paper. Map out what you want content wise and write it down. Having a nice roadmap for your website makes life easier when you begin to code. Any basic website should include a nice homepage. Here you would want to establish your company as a whole. Here you should include any relevant information pertaining to the company that they would want advertised. For example, if you are offering any new programs, products, or even making expansions to grain elevators, you would want to advertise this on the main page as it is going to be the first thing your users are going to see. If you want to have a good homepage you need to establish what needs to be on this in order to show your purpose.

Depending on what your boss will want, some basic other pages to include should be a contact page, about page, a location page, and a cash bid page.

Grain merchandising companies are all about using the phone to call clients and buy their grain. Including a contact page is a must. Here you can list your company’s grain buyers and how to get into contact with them. Odds are most of your clients are going to use your website to see what you are about, and it is good to advertise a way to get into contact with the employees. This is just another way of getting your name out there.

The about page is traditional for almost any type of company. Here include content that gives background information on why your company differs from the competition, what makes you stand out. Include a little history about your company and how it has strived to be a leader in the agriculture industry. This page should just give a little information that stands out to potential clients.

Most merchandising companies will also include a location page, this is because merchandisers buy grain which is then taken to surrounding grain mills for delivery. Including a page that has a picture of the location along with that specific mill’s address and phone number helps client’s delivery the grain easily.

Cash bids are what the company offers to farmers and other grain companies. Simply create a link that will take them to a list of each grain commodity and the specific price at that time. This is really useful for clients who are concerned about the price they may receive. It will calm their nerves and make them confident they are selling to the right company.

You will want to also include a nice logo and slogan. On most every company’s website in today’s world they have their logo and/or slogan on their website so it stands out. It is all about branding and showing the online community that your company is competitive and prosperous. Include this on each page. I have found that putting it at the top of the page catches the eye of the reader first. Viewers also tend to appeal more to images and videos as well. Feel free to add any relevant digital media to the website. This attracts the eyes while also helping to limit a lot of text. You do not want to bore your audience with four pages of all text. Mix it up a bit and also include bulleted lists or numbered lists when needed. White space is not your enemy!

Include a nice font, in today’s world Helvetica is making a dominating appearance as it flows smoothly and is professional in appearance. It is a great font because it fits in with almost any design on the web these days. It works well in almost any size you can imagine. Just make sure to size the text according to how you want the readability to be. Titles and headings should be larger while your body content should be smaller.

## Creating the Right Layout

Readability is key! The great thing about the internet today is there are a ton of awesome bootstrap templates out there that you can download and make changes to suit the layout you want. Work smarter not harder.

Basic layout will include the following elements:
-	Header
-	Navigation Bar
-	Title
-	Headings
-	Subheadings
-	Body
-	Images/Videos
-	Internal/external CSS
-	Links
-	Lists

### The Header

Creating a header within HTML creates a nice smooth top of your website’s page. It is useful because once you create the right header for you, you can reuse it for every page. Include your logo, website title, and slogan within this. You can evenly space these out by using divs with rows and columns. Usually the page is divided into 12, so in this case you could evenly space out these three elements into four columns taking up the full page of 12. Just insert your divs within the code for the header, it is that simple.

### The Navigation Bar

The navigation bar usually codes right below or in the header, based on your preference. Your roadmap is not going to be good unless your navigation is clear. Use clear and logical names for your pages within the navigation bar. You can find horizontal or vertical navigation code anywhere on the internet, when it comes to the purpose of creating a grain merchandising navigation menu the horizontal bar works better. When you are creating it put yourself in the user’s shoes. Set it up as if you were thinking about what they are trying to get done. Tailor it to their needs.

### The Body

The body of your website is one of the most important aspect of it. You must layout your content within this in the most efficient manner to ensure your website looks and reads well. The first thing you should do is to include that pages title, usually in the top right hand corner of the body in a heading one format. Make sure to remember to space out your title from your other body’s content so it stands out. You must remember that with bootstrap everything is also a div, so this would be its own independent div that would take up the whole 12 columns of the page. Using CSS you can also design this to be the color and font you want as well.

Use headings and subheadings to separate information that is relevant to each section. Using heading two and heading three code will create smaller text to deviate from what is a heading and what is a subheading. Remember to include your text within this heading as well as relevant images using the paragraph and image code. Again, you can easily use bootstrap to deviate from where you want text, lists, and images within your body. This helps to align images with text for a more even flow of material. Pay close attention to spacing and content use within the body, as this is your main part of the website. Remember to include links where needed to outside references or other useful pages like commodity prices or informative articles.

### Internal/External CSS

This is where you control how your page is going to appear. It is one of the most important aspects of layout and style in coding websites. You can either create your Style Sheet internally within your HTML or you can link an external CSS code to your HTML. Which one you use will probably depend on what your boss wants and what you are comfortable with. Use this code to create a background color for your website, id text, id specific divs that you want to be a different color, create a colored header, as well as many other specific actions you want.

There are many different ways to code CSS, use the internet if you are looking for a specific action on a specific part of your HTML code that you want to include. Here you can create an id for almost anything and link it into your HTML coding. Say you want a specific div to be aligned right with a black color versus the white background. All you have to do is create this specific text align and color within your specific div’s id in CSS. CSS is a universal tool used by web designers to take your content, and specifically create the layout you want. By using CSS and bootstrap together, you can create almost any website you want.

Knowing what content to use and how to lay it out is the only way to make a bland website into something special, and the agriculture world needs more of this!
